I'm noting down things I did and stuff I used while setting up Linux mint as my development machine for Ruby on Rails.
 
* #### Imwheel
  * As far as I know, there is no way to directly manage the scroll wheel speed of your mouse in Linux Mint. The default speed is let's just say less than desirable.
  * Imwheel helps us manage and control the scroll speed very precisely.
  * [Imwheel setup documenation](http://www.webupd8.org/2015/12/how-to-change-mouse-scroll-wheel-speed.html).

* #### Snap
  * Installing snap on linux mint lets you install tools which you'd have to procure through PPA's.
  * Steps to install snap are outlined [here](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snap-on-linux-mint).
* #### Ruby
  * The next step I took was to install ruby; installing ruby without a ruby version manager is just inviting trouble.
  * I like **rbenv** for the task, you can choose **rvm** too.
  * DigitalOcean has some nice [documentation](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-with-rbenv-on-ubuntu-18-04) to get you started on this.  
* #### Eyecandy
  * Upping the way your desktop looks never hurt anyone.
  * I've installed the [Paper icon pack](https://snwh.org/paper/download) by `Sam Hewitt`.
  * Linux mint theme store also had `Adapta Nokto` which gave my desktop that dark sombre look.
